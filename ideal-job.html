<h2>What interest me in this role:</h2>
<p>The salary in this job advertisement is what attracted me to this role.  My research shows that DevOps role is created because of the of the problems that arise due to separation between of two teams, namely the developers and the operation/software implementation team.  The separated created issues in fine-tubing and debugging the released software.  By amalgamating the two teams into one (a.k.a as DevOps), the responsibility for successful software development and  implementation now falls within one team called DevOps. This enhanced accountability, and reduced time to debug and implement software successfully.    The DevOps role has three major components: development, testing and delivery.

<h2>Skills, qualifications, and experience required for the positions:</h2>
<p>According to Edureka Master in Programming video, DevOps engineers need to be able to use scripting codes, writing codes for infrastructure, understand cloud technology, be able to communicate professionally and work with others, knowledge of continuous integration and delivery, proficient in various DevOps tools such as Linux, scripting,   SCM, GitHub,  Jenkins, Selenium, Amazon AWS,  ISM, puppet, chef, ansible, docker, Splunk. 3
</p>

<h2>Skills, qualifications, and experience I currently have:</h2>
<p>I have developed a relatively good skill in communicating and working well with others through my work.  My work in accounting involves resolving accounting issues on a daily basis. This often requires collaboration with others.  I have accounting experience and skill such as preparing financial reports, knowledge of the financial markets, validating the numbers presented in the report, time management,  proficient in Microsoft Excel, and able to automate daily tasks using Microsoft excel.
A plan how I will obtain the skills, qualifications, and experience required for the position, building on those  I currently have:
To be able to qualify for this DevOps role, I would need to complete a tertiary qualification in computer science, and IT work experience.    I also need to be able to write codes, understand infrastructure function in an organization, able to communicate and work well with others, and know the various tools that DevOps use as mentioned by video created by Edureka Master in Programming. 3
