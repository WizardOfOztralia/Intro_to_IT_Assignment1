<h2>What interest me in this role:</h2>
<p>The salary in this job advertisement is what attracted me to this role.
  My research shows that DevOps role is created because of the of the problems that arise due to separation between of two teams,
  namely the developers and the operation/software implementation team.
  The separated created issues in fine-tubing and debugging the released software.
  By amalgamating the two teams into one (a.k.a as DevOps), the responsibility for successful software development and
  implementation now falls within one team called DevOps. This enhanced accountability,
  and reduced time to debug and implement software successfully.<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrgk023l4lI">2</a></sup>
  The DevOps role has three major components: development, testing
  and delivery.<sup><a href="https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=devops+engineers+explained&docid=608022740851053979&mid=77E258B943A1D2578D9877E258B943A1D2578D98&view=detail&FORM=VIRE">3</a></sup>
