<h1>Project</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
The project will be about creating an app on iPhone that provide tourist information for “The Great Ocean Road” locality (i.e., ‘sight-seeing’, ‘activities’, ‘café and restaurants’ , and ‘local arts’) within one app.
This project is interesting because could have the business aspect of creating revenues to local businesses.
Currently no website or app exist that I am aware of that show case this information within one website/app.  A tourist who wants to explore the area has to perform various google search to explore an area. Combining all in app makes travel easier and provides a more pleasant travel experience.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
For anyone visiting the Great Ocean Road the first time, searching for sight-seeing places, café, eatery, and cultural places are not that simple. The information are available, but they have to combine multiple information from different website to plan their journey. Potentially they could miss a great place to see.
“Visit Victoria” states that visitors spent $1.5 billion in the Great Ocean Road region by June 2019 financial year.   By providing all information in one app, it  provides better travel experience.  It can also increase revenues for local businesses (art exhibitions, café, restaurants) that are featured by the app.

<h2>Description</h2>
The app is a user friendly app that provides information of the Great Ocean Road to those who want to visit the area.  These information include sight-seeing places, activities to do, eatery, and local arts and community events.
In the main page, user has the option to enter their name, username, and email address, and to create a login.
After creating a login, the app will provide categories that user can explore. These categories include:
1.	Sight-seeing places (such as Aireys Inlet lighthouse, Torquay beach, the Twelve Apostle)
2.	Activities that user can do (hiking, cycling, walking)
3.	Café and restaurants (i.e., specific restaurants and cafes in the locality such as The Salty Dog Cafe)
4.	Local Arts (provides specific art exhibitions)
Once users select the categories of interest, the app will provide specific location that they can visit.
After categories of interest, the app will provide specific places that can be visited.
As an example:
•	After selecting sight-seeing places, users can choose to visit Aireys Inlet lighthouse, Twelve Apostle, and so on.
•	After selecting activities, there will be sub-activities such as hiking, cycling, or walking.  After selecting the sub-activities, a specific location is provided.
•	After selecting café and restaurants, then specific restaurants/ cafes can be selected.
•	After selecting local Arts, the users can then choose the art exhibitions they want to see.
After selecting the specific places to see, the app will provide information such interest facts about the place, relevant photos, rating and comments from other users about the place, website of the place if it is a business, and other relevant information.  The users should also have the option to be able to navigate to the place of interest.
More importantly, the specific places should be able to be sorted by rating system.  The rating system has to be gathered reliability.  This will help users to determine quickly the worth of their time and money in visiting a certain place as well as provide better travel planning experience.
The pages should also offer viewing in a map, or a list view.  Map view will enable users to visualise the locations of the places within the map.  Within the map view, users should be able to choose if they want to see all categories, or only a certain category such as “café and eater” only, or “sight-seeing places” only, or “arts exhibitions” only. They should also be able to choose to select multiple categories or all categories for viewing within a map.  Both the map view and list view should allow users to change their viewing preferences. This means users can swap from map view to list view, and vice versa.
Tools and Technologies
Xcode is a tool that is free and uses swift programing language. For Windows it can be downloaded using MacStadium First.
Figma is a web-browser UI design tool that that are used to create app and website. It is currently deemed to be the best in the industry with features to deemed useful for the design processes.
The project can use Cloud which is data storage centre managed by a third-party cloud provider.
GitHub is another tool that is also needed.

<h2>Skills Required</h2>
The majority of developing my skill will need to be spent will be learning swift programming language used which is the programming language used in XCode. In addition, I also need to learn about User Interface, GitHub and being able to communicate and work well within the team.
To make the project successful, gaining feedback from local community, council and app users of how they want to see the end project completion should be insightful to the development of the project. Therefore, communication and team work, and ability to resolve obstacles are also crucial to the project.
Outcome
The success of the project hinges on whether the app provide better navigation experience in the Great Ocean Road vicinity.   Instead of performing multiple searches in google, users should be able to be informed of the various categories (sight-seeing places, café and restaurants, activities to do, and local art exhibitions) in Great Ocean Road at the tip of their fingers.  This should allow to manage their travel plan better and enhance their travel experience.
If the project is successful, it has the potential to be turned into an app that can be published and downloaded in the App Store.
