    I am an accountant working for a US company based in Australia.<br><br>
    Pastime<br>
    I like to hang out with friends on the weekend.  We usually go for lunch and go to have coffee afterwards.  We also like to go for day trips.
    I like travelling to places such as the Great Ocean Road, Torquay, and Daylesford.
    My weekend get-away is the Great Ocean Road. Every time I make a road trip there, I seem to always find something fresh to see and do. <br>
