<h1>Personality Profile</h1>
<h2>What do the personality test results mean for me?</h2>

<p>According to Myers-Brigs personality test  , my personality is classified as “Logistician”. The test result shows that I pride on integrity which includes commitment to work and honesty.  I work well with well-defined responsibilities, expectation, and clear instructions. I am also a visual person which means I learn better when there is visual representation such as diagram, graphics, and other visual aid that enhances learning. The result of the third test from “Big Five Test” reinforces the test result that has been outlined by the Myers-Briggs personality test.<p>

<h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
<p>In a team environment, as I need to have to set a clear expectation of what is required to complete the project well, first it is imperative to setup a structure from the start.  The team needs to brainstorm of the project and determine a list of tasks that need to be completed, allocate the tasks as responsibilities to each group members, and provide a clear timeline of when these tasks need to be completed by. We also need to a regular group project update as an opportunity for each member to provide update on the progress of their tasks of the assignment.  Should the member have difficulty in completing the assignment, this regular meeting can be used to discuss and communicate with other people in group in solving the issue e.g., whether he or she needs directions to complete the assignment, if other people in the group can help to complete the tasks, and so on. As a second point, as I have high commitment towards integrity, I also expect others to have the same level of integrity. Logistician personality type tend to abhor when others do not give their best.  Instead of being judgmental and blaming, I need to be able to communicate better of bringing attention of the issues and resolving the issues collectively to achieve an outcome where the project can still be completed to a high standard and on time. On a final point, strong work ethics of a logistician can be open to misuse as if other people do not put in their share of work, as logisticians tend to take over the extra loads. Whilst logistician may not complain to directly, they do resent the fact that other people do not take the work responsibly.  To overcome this, I will need to communicate with the group members more openly in terms of how the workload should be divided if a team member fails to deliver and how the member who fails to deliver should make up for the lack of contribution (if possible).</p>

<h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h2>

<p>In forming a team, it could be easier if I could choose to work with the same personality type that of ‘logistician’.  However, this may not always be possible as people have different personality types. I need to be able to work with others despite the differences in personality type. As such I need to understand that whilst I have high expectation when performing task, this can be expected only of myself. I cannot force my expectation with other people. I can only communicate of the goals and expectation, and to manage my expectation of them by encouraging them and reminding them that ultimately, we all have the same desired goals such as doing well in this subject.  When they fail to deliver, I need to learn to communicate the issue to the group, understand that the issue can be fixed and as something to be solved. The issue is not about a person and thus avoid blaming game. I also can ask the group to brainstorm to solve the issue so that we could perform the project well. I also need to be mindful that I only need to try my best and not compare myself with other people as some of them may already have been worked in IT and ahead of the game in the IT world.</p>
