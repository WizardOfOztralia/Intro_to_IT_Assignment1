  <h1>Interests in IT </h1>
</header>

<main>
  <p>My work in accounting involves working with teams located abroad.  The people I work with are passionate, hard working and intelligent. The huge difference in salary between myself and the teams abroad is largely because I am remunerated based on the Australian standard of living.  To remain competitive in a competitive job market, I believe that I need to upgrade myself.  That is the reason I am currently studying IT.
  </p>

  <p>My purpose to study Bachelor of Information Technology is to upskill myself in Information Technology. I also want to earn higher income to be able to provide for my future family. As I have mentioned, the accounting job market is highly competitive.  Apart from upgrading my skill to remain competitive, I also want to explore better job opportunities that require both accounting and IT skill. As I continue my study and understand more of the IT job market and industry, I may also ultimately pursue IT career that may not have anything to do accounting.</p>

  <p>I have used Microsoft Excel formulas to automate daily accounting tasks. Automation saves valuable resource named time to complete tasks.  It requires IT knowledge in Microsoft Excel. The process of performing tasks simpler and quicker sparked my interest to study IT. Early in my accounting career,  I used SQL to perform accounting reconciliation, which is an accounting term that involves matching a set of data against another set of data.
  </p>

  <p>RMIT has the highest university ranking amongst other universities from the Open University.
    This makes it the logical university to study IT. In 2023 it ranked 190 globally <sup><a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2023">1</a></sup>  .  RMIT locality being based in Melbourne is another reason to study there.    I am keen to connect with other students who reside in Melbourne to expand my network of friends.
  </p>

  <p>At this stage studying IT is very much an exploration to get a taste of what IT work will be like and to also explore prospective career path. During my study I hope to be able to learn current and contemporary IT knowledge and to be able to use those skills in university projects. After I graduate I hope to build upon the skills further and join the profession.</p>
